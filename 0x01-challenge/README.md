# 0x01. Fix my code

## Background Context

`Fix my code` is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometime you will know the language, sometime not.

Please download the repository [0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!
